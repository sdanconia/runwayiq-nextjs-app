This guide will help you set up the complete AI Cold-Calling Platform that has been integrated into your existing RunwayIQ dashboard.

## üéØ What's Been Built

We've successfully integrated a **production-ready AI Cold-Calling Platform** into your existing RunwayIQ dashboard with the following features:

### ‚úÖ Core Features Implemented

1. **AI-Powered Conversations** - Real-time AI agents that can handle natural phone conversations
2. **Campaign Management** - Create, start, pause, and monitor cold-calling campaigns
3. **Lead Management** - Import leads, track call attempts, and manage follow-ups
4. **Live Call Monitoring** - Real-time dashboard showing active calls with live transcripts
5. **Analytics & Reporting** - Track connection rates, interest levels, and campaign performance
6. **Secure API Integration** - Encrypted storage of API keys for Twilio, OpenAI, and ElevenLabs

### üèó System Architecture

- **Frontend**: React components integrated into existing dashboard
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with Supabase database
- **Real-time**: WebSocket support for live call monitoring
- **AI Pipeline**: OpenAI Whisper (STT) ‚Üí GPT-4 (Conversation) ‚Üí ElevenLabs (TTS)
- **Telephony**: Twilio for making and managing phone calls
- **Queue System**: Background job processing for call automation

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you can start making AI cold calls, you'll need accounts and API keys for:

1. **Twilio** (for phone calls)
2. **OpenAI** (for AI conversations)
3. **ElevenLabs** (for realistic voice synthesis)
4. **Redis** (for job queue - optional for basic setup)

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Database Setup

Run the database migration to add the cold-calling tables:

```bash
# In your Supabase SQL Editor, run the contents of:
database-schema-extension.sql
```

This adds tables for:
- `ai_agents` - AI agent configurations
- `calling_campaigns` - Campaign management
- `calling_leads` - Lead tracking
- `calls` - Call records and transcripts
- `call_queue` - Background job queue
- `api_keys` - Secure API key storage

### Step 2: Get API Keys

#### Twilio Setup
1. Sign up at [twilio.com](https://twilio.com)
2. Get your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** from the console
3. Purchase a phone number for outbound calls
4. Configure webhooks (see Step 4)

#### OpenAI Setup
1. Sign up at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create an API key
3. Ensure you have access to GPT-4 and Whisper APIs

#### ElevenLabs Setup
1. Sign up at [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io)
2. Create an API key
3. Choose voice IDs for your AI agents

### Step 3: Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Existing Supabase vars...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://gapmflftarqpczpzwxba.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImdhcG1mbGZ0YXJxcGN6cHp3eGJhIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTA3Mjk1NzAsImV4cCI6MjA2NjMwNTU3MH0.8JNSBIfaPgbiTqmMomHUUlfJnurlae1FNkg_jeQE4ZU
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_from_supabase_dashboard

# New AI Cold-Calling vars
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
ENCRYPTION_SECRET=your_32_char_secret_for_api_key_encryption

# App URL for webhooks
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 4: Twilio Webhook Configuration

In your Twilio console, configure these webhooks:

1. **Voice URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/twilio/voice/[call-id]`
2. **Status Callback**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/twilio/status`

For local development, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose your localhost:

```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose your local server
ngrok http 3000

# Use the ngrok URL for webhooks
```

### Step 5: Test the Setup

1. Start your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Go to your sales dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/sales-dashboard`

3. Click on the **"AI Cold Calling"** tab

4. Create your first AI agent and campaign

## ü§ñ Creating Your First AI Agent

- **Do Not Call Lists**: Automatically respect DNC requests
- **Call Recording**: Inform prospects of recording (built into prompts)
- **Data Retention**: Configure automatic deletion of old recordings

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Calls not connecting**
   - Check Twilio credentials
   - Verify webhook URLs are accessible
   - Ensure phone number is properly formatted

2. **AI not responding**
   - Check OpenAI API key and usage limits
   - Verify system prompt is not too long
   - Check Whisper transcription quality

3. **Poor voice quality**
   - Check ElevenLabs API key
   - Try different voice IDs
   - Adjust voice stability settings

4. **Webhook errors**
   - Use ngrok for local development
   - Check webhook URL configuration in Twilio
   - Verify API endpoints are responding

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by adding to `.env.local`:

```env
DEBUG_COLD_CALLING=true
```

This will log all API calls, transcriptions, and AI responses.

## üö¢ Production Deployment
